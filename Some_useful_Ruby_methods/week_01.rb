printf

Another output method we use a lot is printf, which prints its arguments under the control of a format string 
(just like printf in C or Perl).

printf("Number: %5.2f,\\nString: %s\\n", 7.18, "FORPC101")
The output is:

#{"Number: %5.2f  \nString: %s" % [7.18, "FORPC101"]}

In this example, the format string 
"Number: %5.2f,\\nString: %s\\n" 
tells printf to substitute in a floating-point number (allowing five characters in total, 
with two after the decimal point) and a string. 
Notice the newlines (\\n) embedded in the string; 
each moves the output onto the next line.

step

Class Numeric also provides the more general method step, which is more like a traditional for loop.

8.step(40, 5) {|i| print i, " " }
This produces an output as:

8 13 18 23 28 33 38 

exit( true | false | status=1 )

The method exit terminates your program, returning a status value to the operating system. 
The optional parameter is used to return a status code to the invoking environment. 
With an argument of true, exits with a status of zero. 
With an argument that is false (or no argument), exits with a status of 1, otherwise exits with the given status.

For example:

exit 99
will exit with a status of 99.

local_variables returns the names of the current local variables in a particular context. 
It is a reflective method and can be placed anywhere in the program ie. even on line 1. In the example:

a = 10
def mtd
  b = 20
end
puts local_variables
The output is:
#{a = 10}
#{local_variables}
a
