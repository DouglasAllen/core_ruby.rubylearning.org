===  Week 1: Tutorial

  #    Welcome to the Online Ruby Programming Course.
  
  #    The response to this course has been over-whelming
  #    with participants from all across the globe.
  
  #    Initially the pace of the course would be slow but
  #    would pick up as the weeks go by. 
  #    

  #   Before we begin: 
  #     Have you read and understood the following three pages?
  #     Read This First
  #     Course FAQ
  #     RubyLearning FAQ

  #   Let's Start: 
  #     Ruby History and Philosophy
  #     Yukihiro Matsumoto, commonly known as 'Matz' created
  #     the Ruby language in 1993.
  
  #     An interview with him in 2001, talks about the history of Ruby. 

===  Instructions
  
  #   Please read through the following pages, in the given order. 
  #   While doing so, please make a note of all your doubts, queries,
  #   questions, clarifications and after you have completed all the pages,
  #   post these on the Lesson 1: Forum here.
  
  #   There may be some questions that relate to something that has not
  #   been mentioned or discussed by me here; you could post the same too. 

  #   You need to read the following page:
  #   Introduction, to understand the conventions being used in the 
  #   topics mentioned below:

  #   Installation
  #   First Ruby program
  #   Features of Ruby
  #   Numbers in Ruby
  #   String fundamentals
  #   Variables and Assignment
  #   Scope
  #   Getting Input
  #   Ruby Names
  #   More on Ruby Methods
  #   Writing own Ruby methods

  #   Note: All the programs in the above lessons work with Ruby 1.9
  
===  Imortant Points
  
  #   Some of the important points to remember after you have read
  #   through the above pages are:

=== Ruby 1.9 on a Windows platform
  
  #   We are discussing Ruby 1.9 on a Windows platform.
  #   This course is appropriate for Linux/Mac users as well.
  #   Ruby is an interpreted language.
  #   In Ruby, there's always more than one way to solve a given problem.
  #   The code examples would be run in the SciTE editor and ensure that
  #   you have done the relevant settings as mentioned on the page
  #   "First Ruby program".
  #   Code layout is pretty much up to you;
  #   indentation is not significant but (using two-character indentation) 
  #   you will make friends in the Ruby community if you plan on
  #   distributing your code.

=== Ruby file extensions
  
  #   By convention, Ruby source files have the .rb file extension. 
  #   In Microsoft Windows, Ruby source files sometimes end with .rbw,
  #   as in myscript.rbw.
  #   In Ruby, program execution proceeds in general from top to bottom.
  #   Features:
  #     Free format, Case sensitive, Two type of comments,
  #     Statement delimiters are not required, 
  #     Around 41 Keywords, and all Ruby keywords are written
  #     using ASCII characters, and all operators and other
  #     punctuation are drawn from the ASCII character set.

=== false, nil, and true
  
  #   You may be used to thinking that a false value may be represented
  #   as a zero, a null string, a null character, or various other things.
  #   But in Ruby, all of these are true; in fact, everything is true
  #   except the reserved words false and nil.

=== Online Ruby Documentation
  
  #   We shall be referring to the documentation here:
  #   - http://www.ruby-doc.org/ruby-1.9/index.html

=== puts
  
  #   puts (s in puts stands for string; puts really means put string)
  #   simply writes onto the screen whatever comes after it,
  #   but then it also automatically goes to the next line.

=== Parentheses
  
  # # Parentheses are usually optional with a method call.
  # # These calls are all valid:
  
  foobar 
  foobar() 
  foobar(a, b, c) 
  foobar a, b, c
  
=== Ruby Numbers
  
  #   In Ruby, numbers without decimal points are called integers,
  #   and numbers with decimal points are usually called floating-point
  #   numbers or, more simply, floats.
  #   (you must place at least one digit before the decimal point).
  
  #   Note: The Fixnum and Bignum classes represent integers of differing
  #         sizes. Both classes descend from Integer (and therefore Numeric).
  
  #   Ruby is able to deal with extremely large numbers,
  #   and unlike many other programming languages, there are no
  #   inconvenient limits. Ruby does this with different classes,
  #   one called Fixnum (default) that represents easily managed smaller
  #   numbers, and another, aptly called Bignum, that represents "big"
  #   numbers.
  
  #   Ruby needs to manage internally. Ruby will handle Bignums and Fixnums
  #   for you, and you can perform arithmetic and other operations without
  #   any problems. Results might vary depending on your system's
  #   architecture, but as these changes are handled entirely by Ruby,
  #   there's no need to worry.

=== Common Ruby operators
  
  #   Some very common Ruby operators:
  #    + addition; - subtraction; * multiplication; / division

=== ++ and --
  
  #   The increment and decrement operators (++ and --)
  #   are not available in Ruby, neither in "pre" nor "post" forms.

=== brackets precedence
  
  #   Anything inside brackets is calculated first (or, more technically,
  #   given higher precedence).

=== modulus operator (%)
  
  #   Observe how the modulus operator (%) works in Ruby.

=== arithmetic with integers
  
  #   When you do arithmetic with integers, you'll get integer answers.

=== String literals
  
  #   String literals are sequences of characters between single or double
  #   quotation marks. In Ruby, strings are mutable. They can expand as
  #   needed, without using much time and memory.

=== String concatenation
  
  #   String concatenation is joining of two strings, using the + operator.

=== append to a string
  
  #   The operator << is used to append to a string.

=== Escape sequences
  
  #   Escape sequence is the \ character. Examples:
  #   \", \\, \n, '' is an empty string.

=== compilation error
  
  #   If you get a compilation error like - 
  #   <TypeError: can't convert Fixnum into String> 
  #   it means that you can't really add a number to a string,
  #   or multiply a string by another string.

=== Constants
  
  #   Constants begin with capital letters. Example: PI, Length

=== variable assignment
  
  #   A variable springs into existence as soon as the interpreter sees
  #   an assignment to that variable.

=== whitespace around the assignment operator
  
  
  # # It is a good practice to assign nil to a variable initially.
  # # Use whitespace around the assignment operator:

  foo = nil
  #   not:
  foo=nil
  
=== initialization

  
  # # Use one initialization per line:
  
  level = nil
  size = nil
  
  # # is preferred over:
  level = size = nil
  
  # # But you may do this:
  level, size = nil, nil
  
=== interchange

  
  x, y = y, x
  # # will interchange the values of x and y.
  
=== Local variables
  
  #   Local variables must start with either a lowercase letter or
  #   the underscore character (_), and they must consist entirely of
  #   letters, numbers, and underscores. Examples: india, _usa, some_var

=== Conversions
  
  #   .to_i, .to_f, .to_s are used to convert to an integer, float, string
  #   respectively.

=== Global scope and Global variables

  #   Avoid using Global scope and Global variables.
  #   Global scope means scope that covers the entire program. 
  #   Global variables are available from everywhere within an application,
  #   including inside classes or objects. 
  #   Global variables are distinguished by starting with a dollar-sign ($)
  #   character. The Ruby interpreter starts up with a fairly large number
  #   of global variables already initialized. 
  #   Global variables don't mesh well with the ideals of object-oriented
  #   programming, as once you start using global variables across an
  #   application, your code is likely to become dependent on them. 
  #   Because the ability to separate blocks of logic from one another is a
  #   useful aspect of object-oriented programming, global variables are
  #   not favored.

=== STDOUT
  
  #   STDOUT is a global constant which is the actual standard output
  #   stream for the program.

=== gets
  
  #   gets (get a string) and chomp (a string method) are used to accept
  #   input from a user. gets returns a string and a '\n' character,
  #   while chomp removes this '\n'.  
 
=== Flush
  
  #   Flush flushes any buffered data within io to the underlying operating
  #   system (note that this is Ruby internal buffering only;
  #   the OS may buffer the data as well).
  #   The usage is not mandatory but recommended.

=== format method
  
  #   To format the output to say 2 decimal places,
  #   we can use the Kernel's format method.

=== Ruby Names
  
  #   Ruby Names are used to refer to constants, variables, methods,
  #   classes, and modules. 
  
  #   The first character of a name helps Ruby to distinguish its intended
  #   use.
  #   Lowercase letter means the characters ''a'' though ''z'', as well as
  #   ''_'', the underscore. 
  #   Uppercase letter means ''A'' though ''Z,'' and digit means
  #   ''0'' through ''9.''
  
  #   A name is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or an underscore,
  #   followed by Name characters: 
  #     This is any combination of upper- and lowercase letters,
  #     underscore and digits.
  
  #   The Ruby convention is to use underscores to separate words in a
  #   multi-word method or variable names.

=== declarations
  
  #   You can use variables in your Ruby programs without any declarations. 
  #   Variable name itself denotes its scope (local, global, instance, etc.).
    
  #   Remember the way that local, instance, global, classes, and
  #   constants variables and method names are declared.
  
=== Class, Module, and Constants naming
  
  #   For Class names, Module names and Constants the convention is to
  #   use capitalization, rather than underscores, to distinguish the start
  #   of words within the name.
  
  #   Examples:

  #     my_variable, MyModule, MyClass, MyConstant.

=== object types of variables
  
  #   Any given variable can at different times hold references to
  #   objects of many different types.
  
  #   Variables in Ruby act as "references" to objects,
  #   which undergo automatic garbage collection.
  
  #   For the time being, remember that Ruby is dynamically typed
  #   and that in Ruby, everything you manipulate is an object. 
  #   The results of those manipulations are themselves objects.

  #   The basic types in Ruby are:
  #     Numeric (subtypes include Fixnum, Integer, and Float),
  #     String,
  #     Array,
  #     Hash,
  #     Object, 
  #     Symbol,
  #     Range, and
  #     Regexp.
  
=== self

  #   For the time being, remember that you can always see what
  #   object you are in (current object) by using the special variable self.

=== declare a method
  
  #   We use 'def' and 'end' to declare a method. Parameters are simply a
  #   list of local variable names in parentheses.

=== return type
  
  #   We do not declare the return type;
  #   a method returns the value of the last line.
  
=== method space
  
  #   It is recommended that you leave a single blank line
  #   between each method definition.
  
=== method parameters
  
  #   As per the Ruby convention, methods need parenthesis
  #   around their parameters.

=== weird method suffix characters
  
  #   ''?'', ''!'' and "=" are the only weird characters allowed as method
  #   name suffixes.
  
=== queries
  
  #   Methods that act as queries are often named with a trailing ?
  
  #   Methods that are "dangerous," or modify the receiver,
  #   might be named with a trailing ! (Bang methods).
  
  #   Methods that do assignment use = 
  #   Example:
  
=== assignment
  
     def date= (parameter)
       # # note no space after method name.
       # # ... do something with the parameter.
     end
  
=== default values
  
  #   Ruby lets you specify default values for a method's arguments-values
  #   that will be used if the caller doesn't pass them explicitly.
  #   You do this using the assignment operator.
  #   Example:
  
===

       def date(parameter = Date.today)
         # # ... do something with parameter
       end

=== interpolation operator
  
  #   For now remember that there is an interpolation operator #{...}.

=== alias methods
  
  #   alias creates a new name that refers to an existing method.
  #   When a method is aliased, the new name refers to a copy of the
  #   original method's body. 
  #   If the method is subsequently redefined, the aliased name will
  #   still invoke the original implementation.

=== number of parameters
  
  #   In Ruby, we can write methods that can accept variable number of
  #   parameters.
  
  #   There's no limit to the number of parameters one can pass to a method.
  
  #   The sequence in which the parameters are put on to the stack are left
  #   to right.
  
  #   Whether Ruby passes parameters by value or reference is very
  #   debatable - it does not matter.
