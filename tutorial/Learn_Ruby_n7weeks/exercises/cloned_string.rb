# This time I don't subclass String class. 
# In fact, if you use UnpredictableString.allocate.kind_of?(String) you will get false. 
# This would not be true if I simply did UnpredictableString = String

# The cloning does more than .dup would do, as it is an exact clone of String up to that point, including state and behaviors (Instance variables, Class variables, etc, and methods, including singleton methods, if any).

# Looking through my code comments, you still have a predictable object though.

# But, looking through the comments of my code, and this is because we have cloned a String with the same powers and the same weaknesses as the original String. 
# (Super Hint: Rubinius does not suffer the same fate)
