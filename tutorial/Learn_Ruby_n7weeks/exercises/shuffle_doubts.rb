# Here is one idea, and it displays concerns about whether a UnpredictableString should really be subclassed to String.
# Or if it is causing some additional problems. 
# Note: See how Hash behaves automatically unpredictably when UnpredictableString module is mixed in. 
# But this same thing does not happen when it is String that is mixed in.

# Can anyone spot what is going on? 
# The hint is right there in the module... 

#Anyone want to make their own class that can take advantage of this module? 
# (The lesson here is similar to how you use Comparable or Enumerable module for your own classes.)
